## Welcome to the VicSquad MC Server Page

Praise Vic! 

### Server URL

The server url is ```0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:12505```

It is a free tier ngrok tunnel leading to the server.   
When the server crashes or reboots this url is refreshed and a new one needs to be used. 

### Server Rules

1. Pay your respects to wasvic, our 12 year old great ruler
2. Fun and cooperation are our priority
3. No bullying, racism, sexism or any other form of discrimination is allowed. We're trying to build a better world.
4. No griefing, have fun but not at the cost of other's fun.
5. Ask for your ceremonial Smeagol head, if needed.
